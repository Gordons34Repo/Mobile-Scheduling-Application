## Basic Introduction to Project

This was the final project for **CMPT 395: Software Engineering** where we were tasked with creating a mobile application for a client which served the following features:
- Add / Edit / Remove employees
- Schedule employees to shifts
- Update availability, Add vacation, and other QOL features

The project was developed using [Android Studio Electric Eel 2022.1.1](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/past-releases/as-electric-eel-release-notes), and followed Agile development, more specifically, Scrum. The project was broken into 4 sprints, each of which were 2 weeks in length.

### Main Screen layout

The main screen went over several revisions before we reached our final layout of only 3 buttons. These options are **"View Schedule"**, **"Staff"**, and **"View Today"**. There is also an on-screen dispaly of the current time and date. It was discussed to add the employees working on the current day, but it was cut due to time constraints.

#### View Schedule

&nbsp;- This button redirects to view the current month's schedule.

#### Staff

&nbsp;- This button redirects to view the employee management section of the application.

#### View Today

&nbsp;- This button displays the current day's scheduled employees.
